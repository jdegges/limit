# limit #

Front end to getrlimit and setrlimit. This allows you to get and set various
resource limits on a per-program basis. You might notice that
/etc/security/limits.conf does similar things for users and groups.


# Dependencies

The only dependency is libxml-2.0 which is used for parsing the configuration
file. You can download it for free at http://xmlsoft.org/.


# Supported resources

Currently the following resources are supported:
* AS
* CORE
* CPU
* DATA
* FSIZE
* LOCKS
* MEMLOCK
* MSGQUEUE
* NICE
* NOFILE
* NPROC
* RSS
* RTPRIO

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
